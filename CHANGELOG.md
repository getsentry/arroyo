## Versioning Policy

This project follows [semver](https://semver.org/), with three additions:

- Semver says that major version ``0`` can include breaking changes at any time. Still, it is common practice to assume that only ``0.x`` releases (minor versions) can contain breaking changes while ``0.x.y`` releases (patch versions) are used for backwards-compatible changes (bugfixes and features). This project also follows that practice.

- All undocumented APIs are considered internal. They are not part of this contract.

- Certain features may be explicitly called out as "experimental" or "unstable" in the documentation. They come with their own versioning policy described in the documentation.
