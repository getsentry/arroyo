class Produce(ProcessingStrategy[TPayload]):
    """
    This strategy can be used to produce Kafka messages to a destination topic. A typical use
    case could be to consume messages from one topic, apply some transformations and then output
    to another topic.

    For each message received in the submit method, it attempts to produce a single Kafka message
    in a thread. If there are too many pending futures, we MessageRejected will be raised to notify
    stream processor to slow down.

    On poll we check for completion of the produced messages. If the message has been successfully
    produced then the message is submitted to the next step. If an error occured the exception will
    be raised.

    Important: The destination topic is always the `topic` passed into the constructor and not the
    topic being referenced in the message itself (which typically refers to the original topic from
    where the message was consumed from).

    Caution: MessageRejected is not properly handled by the ParallelTransform step. Exercise
    caution if chaining this step anywhere after a parallel transform.
