    watermark.

    A messages batch is closed and submitted when the maximum number of
    messages is received or when the max_batch_time has passed since the
    first message was received.

    This step does not require in order processing. If messages are sent
    out of order, though, the highest observed offset per partition is
    still the committable one, whether or not all messages with lower
    offsets have been observed by this step.

    downstream steps if they are thrown.
